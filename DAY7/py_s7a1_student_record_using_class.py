# You are creating a system for a school to manage student records. Each student has:
# A name
# An age
# A grade
# A roll number
# Instead of writing separate variables for each student, you decide to create a class
# called Student to represent the blueprint for any student.
# By using a class, you can create multiple student records quickly and manage them
# efficiently.
# Objective
# Define a class called Student.
# Use attributes (name, age, grade, roll number).
# Create multiple student objects.
# Display each studentâ€™s information using a method.
